\section{Background}
This is the technical documentation of the work done by the Robotic Safety group in the course TSBB11 at Linköping University. TSBB11 is a CDIO project course given by the Computer Vision Laboratory where students apply their knowledge from previous theoretical courses in a larger project. The members of the group Robotic Safety all study the Signal- and Image Processing master program. 
The project assigned to the group is in the area of robotics safety and is requested by IEI (Department of Management and Engineering) at Linköping University and relates to the robot SIA20D Motoman by Yaskawa Nordic.
